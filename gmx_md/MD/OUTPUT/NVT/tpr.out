Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'
Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

NOTE 1 [file InP_nvt.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 2 [file InP_nvt.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file InP_nvt.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, consider
  setting nstcomm equal to nstcalcenergy for less overhead

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein is 4568.71
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Water_and_ions is 43011.29

NOTE 4 [file InP_nvt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
