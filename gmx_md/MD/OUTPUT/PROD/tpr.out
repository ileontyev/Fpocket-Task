Ignoring obsolete mdp entry 'ns_type'
Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

NOTE 1 [file InP.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 2 [file InP.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file InP.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, consider
  setting nstcomm equal to nstcalcenergy for less overhead

Cleaning up constraints and constant bonded interactions with virtual sites

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.435 nm between atom 602 and 609

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.910 nm, buffer size 0.010 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
