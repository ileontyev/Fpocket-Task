NOTE 1 [file InP_min.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 2 [file InP_min.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

WARNING 1 [file rubredoxin_solv_ions.top, line 20531]:
  The following macros were defined in the 'define' mdp field with the -D
  prefix, but were not used in the topology:
      POSRES_WATER
  If you haven't made a spelling error, either use the macro you defined,
  or don't define the macro

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 69900.00
The integrator does not provide a ensemble temperature, there is no system ensemble temperature

NOTE 3 [file InP_min.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.
