NOTE 1 [file InP_npt.mdp]:
  With Verlet lists the optimal nstlist is >= 10, with GPUs >= 20. Note
  that with the Verlet scheme, nstlist has no effect on the accuracy of
  your simulation.


NOTE 2 [file InP_npt.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using
  verlet-buffer-tolerance.


NOTE 3 [file InP_npt.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, consider
  setting nstcomm equal to nstcalcenergy for less overhead


WARNING 1 [file InP_npt.mdp]:
  The Berendsen barostat does not generate any strictly correct ensemble,
  and should not be used for new production simulations (in our opinion).
  We recommend using the C-rescale barostat instead.

Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein is 4568.71
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Water_and_ions is 43011.29

NOTE 4 [file InP_npt.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

The largest distance between excluded atoms is 0.435 nm between atom 1187 and 1195

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 298 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 0.901 nm, buffer size 0.001 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 0.900 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
